## Next Steps

### Implementation Phase
1. Set up the environment and verify dependencies
2. Collect the shared offline dataset
3. Train DSF-DT on CartPole-v1
4. Train SNN-DT on CartPole-v1
5. Evaluate both models using the benchmark script
6. Generate the comparison report

### Expected Outcomes
- Trained models for both SNN-DT and DSF-DT
- Benchmark results in CSV format
- Comprehensive comparison report with visualizations
- Reproducible results with documented metrics

## Files Created
All the following files have been created in the project directory:
- `benchmark_plan.md`
- `implementation_plan.md`
- `hyperparameter_comparison.md`
- `matched_config.md`
- `training_plan.md`
- `evaluation_plan.md`
- `comparison_report_template.md`
- `complete_comparison_plan.md`
- `comparison_workflow.md`
- `final_summary.md` (this file)

## Conclusion
The planning phase for comparing SNN-DT and DSF-DT on CartPole-v1 is complete. All necessary documentation has been created to guide the implementation of this comparison. The next step would be to execute the implementation using the Code mode.
