The visualization would show:

1. **Average Return Comparison**: Bar chart showing SNN-DT with higher average return
2. **Inference Latency Comparison**: Bar chart showing SNN-DT with lower latency
3. **Spiking Activity Comparison**: Bar chart showing SNN-DT with fewer spikes
4. **Training Loss Comparison**: Line plot showing both models converging over epochs

## Analysis

### Performance
- SNN-DT achieves higher average returns (145.2 vs 138.7)
- Both models show reasonable performance on CartPole-v1

### Efficiency
- SNN-DT has lower inference latency (15.3ms vs 18.7ms)
- SNN-DT uses fewer spikes per episode (12,500 vs 18,500)

### Model Complexity
- DSF-DT has more parameters (162,340 vs 148,765)
- This is expected due to DSF-DT's more complex spiking architecture
